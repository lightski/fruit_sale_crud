@TODO
  -build some report functionality in totals.php
  -style the whole thing to look reasonable
  -deploy to server, protect with username/password
  -???
  -PROFIT!

FUTURE ADD-ONS
	-Proper data validation in process.php - only characters in fname/lname and only numbers in fruit
	-User switchable years, which creates new table in database
	(and switches to that for inserts and queries) must show up in totals.php as well
	-Success message and failure message for data entry
