data design document- was going to make this two tables, one for students and the other for quantities of fruit.
then I though, nah, that's ridiculous. why make two when one will suffice? they were going to have a 1:1 relationship
anyway, so yeah just decided to go with one.

table 1: students_fruit
ID        fname   lname  "naval_orang_full"  "naval_orang_half"   "red_grape_full" ETC
PK, AI
INT(10)   text    text     INT(3)        *           *


CREATE TABLE students_fruit_2014 (
  ID INT(10) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  fname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,

  mixed_a INT(3),
  mixed_b INT(3),

  gift_l INT(3),

  gift_lp INT(3),
  gitf_sp INT(3),
  pinea INT(3),
  PRIMARY KEY ( ID )
);

EDIT 12/22/14
The time has come to make this application aware of what year it is. So we're adding a new table to track years and prices.
The new table will also point to where each year's records are stored.
ALSO note that the *_price here refers to the price the fruit was sold at, not the purchase price.
We aren't doing anything with purchase price as of now.
