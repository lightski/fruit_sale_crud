data design document- was going to make this two tables, one for students and the other for quantities of fruit.
then I though, nah, that's ridiculous. why make two when one will suffice? they were going to have a 1:1 relationship
anyway, so yeah just decided to go with one.

table 1: students_fruit
ID        fname   lname  "naval_orang_full"  "naval_orang_half"   "red_grape_full" ETC
PK, AI
INT(10)   text    text     INT(3)        *           *


CREATE TABLE students_fruit_2014 (
  ID INT(10) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
